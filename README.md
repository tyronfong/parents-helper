## Background
Case1. One day, my mother travelled to another city, but the plane was delayed to midnight, so she had to find a hotel by herself for that night. She's so tired that she went to bed earlier that before and forgot to say good night to me. Around 1 am, I ring my mother but no answer, I was really really worried till the morning, my mother told me she's phone was muted. ORZ...
Case2. My father always ask me for help about his smart phone, sometimes, no, most of the time, he can not understand the solution I proviced... And I really want to remote my father's phone, and do it myself. Why there is no good stuff like "Remote Desktop", I used TeamViewer before, but it's hard to setup, and incompatible for some smart phones.
